# Mixer control. All attributes defined herein are namespaced
# by alsatplg to "mixer.N.attribute_name"
#
# Usage: this component can be used by instantiating it in the parent object. i.e.
#
# 	Object.mixer."N" {
#		pipeline_id	1
#		index	0
#	}
#
# Where N is the unique instance number for the buffer object within the same alsaconf node.
# The mixer control object should also include the ops, channels and tlv objects.
